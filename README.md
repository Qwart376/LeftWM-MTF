# LeftWM Modular Theme Framework

WARNING: THIS IS STILL IN ALPHA PHASE. I'm not currently on Linux and can't test things out. Project will enter beta phase once I confirm stability

MTF provides barebones theme framework with ready to use moddules, templates, and documentation that allows anyone to create their own theme. It was orginally based off my other work, Blue Coffee, and after a year I finally got time to upload and work on the project.

Feh is supported, later on Nitrogen support will be added
